   - Include tags like `<header>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`, `<section>`, and `<article>` to organize your content.

3. **Validate Your Code**
   - Use the [W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) to ensure your code is error-free and compliant.

4. **Add CSS**
   - Style your page using CSS.
   - Focus on layout, typography, and any necessary design details.

5. **Test the Page**
   - Open the page in a browser to ensure it displays correctly.
   - Compare the result with the provided design or wireframe.

## **Project Structure**
The project should be organized as follows:
project-folder/ │ ├── index.html # Main HTML file ├── styles.css # CSS file for styling (if applicable) ├── README.md # Project documentation
