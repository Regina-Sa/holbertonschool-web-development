# **HTML Advanced - Project 0**

## **Description**
This project focuses on creating the HTML structure of a webpage from a professional design file available on Figma. The main objective is to produce semantic and standards-compliant HTML code without any styles or CSS.

For this first task, the emphasis is solely on **HTML structure**, building a strong foundation for future projects.

---

## **Objectives**
- Learn how to translate a Figma design file into an HTML structure.
- Use semantic HTML tags to organize the content effectively.
- Ensure compliance with web standards by creating W3C-valid code.
- Practice writing clear and professional README documentation.

---

## **Figma File**
The design file for this project is available on **Figma**. You can access it via this link: [Page in Figma](#) *(replace with the actual link)*.

### **Instructions:**
1. **Create a Figma account** if you donâ€™t already have one.
2. **Duplicate the file to your drafts** to view the design details.
3. Download the missing fonts if needed:
   - [Source Sans Pro](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Sans+Pro)
   - [Spin Cycle OT](#) *(replace with the actual link if available)*.

### **Important Notes:**
- Some design elements use **float values** (e.g., 12.5px). Feel free to round these values when necessary.

---

## **Requirements**
1. **HTML only:** No styles or CSS are allowed for this task.
2. **Semantic structure:**
   - Use appropriate tags like `<header>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`, `<section>`, etc.
   - Avoid unnecessary `<div>` or `<span>` elements.
3. **W3C Validation:** Code must pass validation using the [W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org/).
4. **Standards compliance:**
   - All files should end with a newline.
   - Code should be organized and easy to read.

## **Project Structure**
### **GitHub Repository**
- **Repository name:** `holbertonschool-web-development`
- **Directory:** `html_advanced`
- **Main file:** `README.md`

### **Deliverables**
1. **README.md:** A well-documented file explaining the project.
2. **index.html:** The HTML file containing the structure of the webpage.

## **Setup Instructions**
1. Clone the GitHub repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/holbertonschool-web-development.git
   ```

---

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```
cd holbertonschool-web-development/html_advanced
```

3. Open the index.html file in your preferred browser to view the structure.

```
open index.html
```

## **Validation Steps**
Open the W3C Validator.
Upload your index.html file or copy-paste its content into the validator.
Review any errors or warnings and fix them in your code.
Compare your HTML structure with the Figma file to ensure consistency.
